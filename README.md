# IPL Data Analysis - Tableau - Python
This project is about performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning on Indian Premier League (IPL) datasets and then creating Tableau dashboards on the cleaned dataset for data analysis purpose.

## Project Overview
- The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India that is contested annually by ten teams representing ten different cities or states in India. The league was founded in 2008 and is one of the most popular and lucrative cricket tournaments in the world.

- The aim of this project is to analyze the IPL data from 2008 to 2020 and gain insights into various aspects of the game, such as team performance, player performance, match outcomes, toss decisions, venues, seasons, etc. The project involves the following steps:

## Data collection 
The IPL data is collected from Kaggle. The data consists of two CSV files: matches.csv and balls.csv. The matches.csv file contains information about each match, such as date, venue, teams, toss, result, etc. The balls.csv file contains information about each ball delivered in each match, such as batsman, bowler, runs scored, wickets taken, etc.

## Exploratory Data analysis 
The IPL data is analyzed using Python to perform various statistical and graphical methods to explore and understand the data. The analysis involves finding patterns, trends, correlations, and insights from the data using statistics and correlation

## Data cleaning 
The IPL data is cleaned using Python - Pandas and Numpy to remove or impute missing values, duplicates, errors, outliers, and inconsistent values.

## Data visualization 
The cleaned IPL dataset is visualized using Tableau to create interactive dashboards that communicate the findings clearly and effectively. The dashboards include various graphical representations of the data.
